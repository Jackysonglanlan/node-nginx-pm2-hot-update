# /usr/sbin/logrotate – The logrotate command itself.
# /etc/cron.daily/logrotate – This shell script executes the logrotate command everyday.

# How-To use:
#
# Move this file to /etc/logrotate.d/
#
# Run script to test:
#   /usr/sbin/logrotate -s ./logstatus -vdf /etc/logrotate.d/nginx-logrotate
#
# "-s", specifies the filename to write the logrotate status.
# “-v”, tells logrotate to say what it’s doing while it’s doing it. It’s very useful when trying to find out why logrotate doesn’t rotate a log when you want it to.
# “-d”, tells logrotate to go through the motions of rotating logs but not actually rotate them.
# “-f”, forces logrotate to rotate all logs when it runs, whether or not they would normally need to be rotated at that time. If you want to thoroughly test logrotate’s configs this is the flag to use. Just remember that logrotate will be rotating logs and deleting old ones according to the configuration you’ve set up, so don’t accidentally rotate out a recent log you needed to keep.

# 所有日志都在 logs 文件夹下, 见 nginx-conf.production.json 的 settings.logs 和 ecosystem.json 的 apps.{out,error}_file
